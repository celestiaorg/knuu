## Contribution Workflow

To contribute to Knuu, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository: Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
 
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone <forked-repository-url>
```

3. Create your working branch: In the project directory, create a new branch by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git checkout -b working-branch
```
Be sure to name your branch according to the changes you are making.
For example: `add-missing-tests`.

4. Make your changes: Do not address multiple issues per PR. 
For example, if you are adding a feature, it should not have bug fixes too. This is to enable the maintainers review your PR efficiently.

5. Commit the changes to your branch: After making the desired changes to the repo, run the following commands to commit them:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "add an appropriate commit message"
```

```bash
git push origin <working-branch>
```

To ensure that your contribution is working as expected, please run `knuu-example` with your fork and working branch.

5. Create a Pull Request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and be sure that you are in the branch you pushed the changes to. Click on the 'Compare & pull request' button. This will open a new page where you can create your PR. Fill in the description field and click on 'Create pull request'.
Be sure to name your PR with a semantic prefix. For example, if it is a fix, it should be specified with the `fix:` prefix.

Congratulations! You have successfully made a Pull Request, and your changes will be reviewed by the maintainers.
